Changing careers is hard. It's not just about learning new skills, new jargon, or adapting to different ways of working. It also about rediscovering yourself and your place in the world, as you you grapple with existential issues of identity, belonging, and meaning. 

If you're looking for a supportive and engaging community of people on a similar trajectory to you---that is, physicists and mathematicians exploring nonlinear careers---then AITW is for you. It's less scary and more fun to go on this journey together!

See you soon!
