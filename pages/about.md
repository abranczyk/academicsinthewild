Academics in the Wild (AITW) is an initiative to support physicists and mathematicians in their journey from academia to industry. If you're currently on any stage of that journey, we would love to have you on board!

The initiative started as a podcast called Physicists in the Wild where Aggie Branczyk interviewed physicists who turned their PhD training into diverse and often unconventional careers.

Now, we are building a community, to be centred around the AITW Discord server, where we will regularly host informative and supportive events related to academia-industry career transitions.

The Discord server has several roles:
- **@Guest** Anyone who joins the server automatically gets this role. Guests can attend public events and post in event-related guest channels when they are open. 
- **@Explorer** 🧭 Physics/math PhD candidates/grads who are exploring industry and want to actively participate in the AITW community, join private events, access archived material. Become an explorer here. 
- **@Ranger** 🤠 Mentors/advisors/AMA-guests/speakers/event-hosts who actively participate in the community. Like explorers, but with industry experience. Apply to be a ranger here.

If you would like stay up-to-date as the initiative grows, subscribe to our mailing list. 

See you soon!
