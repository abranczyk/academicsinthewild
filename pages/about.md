Academics in the Wild (AITW) is an initiative to support physicists and mathematicians in their journey from academia to industry. Our focus is on hosting **events**, creating a space for **community**, and providing relevant **resources**. 

## Events
We love events, so we plan to make them an integral part of the AITW initiative. We have several community events in the works, which you can check out [here](https://academicsinthewild.com/events/). 
## Community
We believe that learning from each other is the best way to nagivate a career transition, so we're building a community on the AITW <a href="https://discord.gg/4h7m5ag9d4">Discord server</a>, where we not only host events but also provide a space for people to interact. 

The Discord server has several roles:
- **@Guest** Anyone who joins the server automatically gets this role. Guests can attend public events and post in event-related guest channels when they are open.
- **@Explorer** ðŸ§­ This role is for physics/math PhD candidates/grads who are exploring or have moved into industry, and who want to actively participate in the AITW community, join private events and channels, and access archived material.
- **@Ranger** ðŸ¤  This role is for mentors/advisors/AMA-guests/speakers/event-hosts who actively participate in the AITW community. They get the same perks as Explorers, plus a few extra ones.

To become an **@Explorer** or a **@Ranger**, please fill out [this form](https://forms.academicsinthewild.com/join-community).
## Resources
Knowledge is Power. We have some great career [resources](https://academicsinthewild.com/resources/) for physics and math PhD candidates and graduates. We host a [podcast](https://physicistsinthewild.buzzsprout.com) for physicists exploring their career options. We will also start a blog discussing relevant topics in the near future. 

If you would like stay up-to-date as the initiative grows, [subscribe](https://forms.academicsinthewild.com/subscribe) to our mailing list. 

See you soon!
